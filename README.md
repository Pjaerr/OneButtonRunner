# OneButtonRunner
One Button Runner is a one button game heavily inspired by The Impossible Game, created as a learning project.

This game is made using C# and the Unity Engine. It is a 2D platforming runner game akin to something like The Impossible Game, Geometry Dash or Vector. I made this game as a learning project but primarily as a way to have actually finished a game.

One Button Runner uses music from various artists, this credits for this music can be found inside of each level select screen.
