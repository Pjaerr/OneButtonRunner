[Finished] OneButtonRunner

One Button Runner is a one button game heavily inspired by The Impossible Game, created as a learning project.

This game is made using C# and the Unity Engine. It is a 2D platforming runner game akin to something like The Impossible Game, Geometry Dash or Vector. I made this game as a learning project but primarily as a way to have actually finished a game.

One Button Runner uses music by Geoplex.

This game took 3 days to make completely. It is the first game I have ever finished, despite dabbling in much more complex stuff, hope you enjoy! An active version of this game can be found at the following website: https://pjaer.itch.io/one-button-runner
